/*
Object-orientied Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm or a style of proramming that is centered around objects rather than functions.

OOP is not a proramming language or tool !!!

_________________________________4 PILLARS________________________

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

____________Encapsulation_____________

Objects can contain related data and code, which represent information about the thing you are trying to model, and functionality or behavior that you want it to have. Object data (and often, functions too) can be stored neatly (the official word is encapsulated) inside an object package (which can be given a specific name to refer to, which is sometimes called a namespace), making it easy to structure and access; objects are also commonly used as data stores that can be easily sent across the network.

Using Encapsulation we group related variables and functions together, and this way we can reduce complexity, and can reuse these objects in different parts of a program or in different programs. (Reduce complexity+increase reusability)

____________Abstraction_____________

Abstraction — creating a simple model of a more complex thing, which represents its most important aspects in a way that is easy to work with for our program's purposes

An abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users. In other words, it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one.

With Abstraction we hide the details and the complexity, and show only the essentials. This technique reduces complexity and also isolates the impact of changes in the code.(Reduce complexity+isolate impact of code)

____________Inheritance_____________

Inheritance helps to eliminate redundant code. 

In OOP, we can create new classes based on other classes — these new child classes (also known as subclasses) can be made to inherit the data and code features of their parent class, so you can reuse functionality common to all the object types rather than having to duplicate it.  Where functionality differs between classes, you can define specialized features directly on them as needed.

With Inheritance we can eliminate the redundant code.

____________Polymorphism_____________

Poly morphism (many forms)

The polymorphism is a core concept of an object-oriented paradigm that provides a way to perform a single action in different forms. It provides an ability to call the same method on different JavaScript objects. As JavaScript is not a type-safe language, we can pass any type of data members with the methods.

With Polymorphism we can refactor ugly switch/case statements.
